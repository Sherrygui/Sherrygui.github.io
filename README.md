The code structure is designed for clarity rather than for browser performance. (Notably, we break CSS out into several files, to help keep code organized.) Even so, the slowdowns will be insignificant for most student/personal sites, and the speed fixes are easy to make.

This project includes elements from HTML5 Boilerplate (see doc/h5bp/ for more).
